# Mine
- a chat room to provide common topic.
## usage
```
cd server
node server.js  // this will listen 3000 port
cd ../
npm run serve   // should listen on 8080 port or 8081 ...
// access localhost:8080
```

## There is three features here
1. Chat Room, if you type @news, in same room for all client there will prompt a news line to provide topic.
2. Chat with bot (only chinese now), you test type "you noob", "hi, hello", etc.
3. Personal profile. this is not really implemented, only use template to let it looks cool.

## Bugs to fix
- in some page, you cant head back to home.
- actually, this is write for smartphone page, so it may looks wired in desktop.
- profile page is not implemented.
- you can only chat at lobby room, currently.
- you cannot add new room or change your username
- in some case you will not be assign with a username T.T
