# Mine
- a chat room to provide common topic.
## usage


## There is three features here
1. Chat Room, if you type @news, in same room for all client there will prompt a news line to provide topic.
2. Chat with bot (only chinese now), you test type "you noob", "hi, hello", etc.
3. Personal profile. this is not really implemented, only use template to let it looks cool.

## Bugs to fix
- in some page, you cant head back to home.
- actually, this is write for smartphone page, so it may looks wired in desktop.
- profile page is not implemented.
